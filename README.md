# Agent-Based Simulation Project
Welcome to our Agent-Based Simulation Project! This initiative provides a unique opportunity to apply the principles of linked lists within the dynamic and interactive realm of agent-based simulations.

## Overview
In this project, we dive into the fascinating world of agent-based models, where we simulate the behavior of agents moving in a continuous 2D landscape. This approach differs significantly from grid-based simulations, like the popular Game of Life, by introducing more fluid and realistic movements.

## Key Features:
+ **2D Continuous Landscape**: Agents operate in a continuous two-dimensional space, using floating-point coordinates for precise positioning.
+ **Dynamic Agent Interaction**: Each agent in our simulation actively interacts with the environment, following a unique updateState method that dictates their behavior and decisions.
+ **Realistic Scaling**: The simulation landscape is scaled to a 1:1 ratio, where each coordinate unit represents a single pixel. For instance, a 500x500 landscape translates to a coordinate range from 0 to 500 in both dimensions.
+ **Inspiration from Pioneers**: Our simulation draws inspiration from "Growing Artificial Societies" by Epstein and Axtell, pioneers in using computational models to explore social science questions about self-organizing societies.
+ **Purpose of the Project**:
This project aims to blend computer science concepts with social science inquiries, offering a platform to explore how individual behaviors can lead to complex societal patterns. It's an excellent opportunity for those interested in simulation, artificial societies, and computational models to experiment and learn.

## Getting Started:
To dive into this simulation, simply clone the repository, follow the setup instructions, and start experimenting with your agents in the 2D landscape. We encourage creativity and exploration, so feel free to modify the agents' behavior and observe the emergent patterns!
